<p><strong>Please do read this documentation! Support might not be given otherwise.
It's generally a good idea to read the documentation,
<em>before</em> you encounter any problems!</strong></p>

<h2><a name="notice">Important Notice</a></h2>
<p><strong>Recaptcha_XH couldn't be tested so far in various environments.
It is a so called BETA version. Use with caution!</strong></p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>Recaptcha_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH.
It requires an UTF-8 encoded version.
To use it, you have to sign in with a Google Account to get the required keys.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.com/wiki/doku.php/manuals:users_manual:plugins:installation">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Backup the data on your server.</strong></li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory recaptcha to your server into the CMSimple_XH plugins directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectories config/ and languages/.</li>
<li><strong>Switch to Recaptcha in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</strong>
Missing requirements will be reported as a warning.
You should not proceed using Recaptcha_XH until all it's requirements are met,
as further checks are avoided for performance reasons,
and that might lead to faulty behaviour.</li>
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other
CMSimple_XH plugins in the website's back-end.
Select Recaptcha from "Plugins".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Recaptcha_XH in "Plugin Config".
Hints for the options will be displayed
when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.
The most important settings are the keys.
To get the required keys for reCAPTCHA you have to create a Google Account, if you do not already have one.
Then you have to <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin">sign up</a> and create the keys.</p>
<p>Localization is done in "Plugin Language".
You can translate the character strings to your own language,
or customize them according to your needs.
Somewhat special is the group "captcha".
This is the localization of reCAPTCHA itself.
For the languages en, nl, fr, de, pt, ru, es and tr
reCAPTCHA already provides localization, so the entries could be left blank.</p>
<p>Currently no stylesheet is distributed with Recaptcha_XH
as it's not clear, if this is really necessary, because there are 4 different themes already available.
And it might be difficult to use the stylesheet in all circumstances,
as reCAPTCHA will be integrated in an IFrame, if Javascript is disabled in the visitors browser.</p>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>Recaptcha_XH is a utility plugin serving other plugins.
As such it has no usage on it's own.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
<p>The audio captcha will probably be available only for some languages.</p>
